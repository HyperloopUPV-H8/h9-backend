# Ethernet View - Backend

This is the official backend for the HyperloopUPV verification software *Ethernet View*.

**This repository has been migrated to [this repo monorepo](https://github.com/HyperloopUPV-H8/h9-software) and will continue to receive updates there**

## Building

The main project file is inside `cmd`, each of the folders contains one version of the backend, the latest is the one with the highest number (so `cmd/MVP-2` is more recent than `cmd/MVP-1`).
To build the project just run `go build` inside one of these folders. In order to run there are three more files that need to be present in the same folder as the executable:
* The frontend build located in a folder named `static` (as the backend also serves the webpage)
* A `.env` with all the configuration options (the one in the repo lists all the possible options)
* The `secret.json` to access the Google API to download the excel (this is only available to us)

alternatively you can download a version that is ready for production from the releases.
